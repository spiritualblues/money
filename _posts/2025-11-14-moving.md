title: "Warning: Moving Cheese Around (Blog Edition)"
---
After much deliberation, I’m excited to announce my blog is officially moving! The Pagecord blog is retiring gracefully—think of it as a well-earned nap after a year of loyal service. All my 'meh' posts are marching proudly into their new home, safely archived at spi.blue/archive thanks to Pagecord’s generous export feature.

Where’s the action now? Enter spi.blue/notes, powered by Jekyll on GitHub Pages: lightning-fast, gloriously customizable, and completely under my control—even without a computer science degree hanging over my desk. The root domain gets a shiny landing page soon, just to keep things classy for first-time visitors.

Redirects and preservation? Absolutely! With a little chatGPT magic and plenty of elbow grease, Google’s search crawlers won’t stumble into any broken links on my watch. If you find one, let me know—I’ll add it to my growing list of “Digital Gremlins to Defeat.”

On top of all that, I’m test-driving Medium like a kid with a new bike. Chasing the next shiny thing is the spice of blogging life, right?
